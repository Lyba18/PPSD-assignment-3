# The Three Best TMS

The quest to find the 3 best Ticketing Management Systems starts by defining what we want in a TMS. Therefore we set up a list of features that we want so then we can see what systems work best for us. Most TMS that we reviewed already have most basic features pretty well done. So unique features or quirks will also be monumental in deciding the best three TMS.

## Criteria

The following criteria was designed with a small startup team working on a SAAS project. Usually startup teams are trying to work in a fast paced enviroment with little resources so its crucial that the TMS is easy to use and also inexpensive.

- Issues can be created through multiple channels
- Easy to create issues
- Easy to assign tasks to different teams/team members
- Can track progress on the task
- Easy correspondence between client and team member who is handling the ticket
- Easy to track the fixes and get reviews from other team members
- Inexpensive

## First Pick: Github Issues

This was our first pick because we started with a SAAS based startup, so most probably they would already have their code base hosted on Github. Therefore it would be easier to have the issue tracking system on the same platform. Github issues does really well on our criteria sheet too. Let's look at some major pros and cons for using Github

### Pros:

- Already in use by a lot of teams which provide SAAS products
- Free to use Forever

### Cons:

- Difficult to understand for users outside the developer community
- Designed for open source software rather than real life products.

## Second Pick: Jira Service Desk

Jira Service Desk is a premium ticketing solution provided by Atlassian. It is a general purpose software which can scale up to be used in companies with multiple teams and tall hierarchies. It not only provides issue tracking facilities between the user and the business but also between the business itself. Members of one team e.g. Accounting can make tickets to be resolved by the other team e.g. Development within the same company. Let's look at some major pros and cons for using Jira Service Desk.

### Pros:

- Used by bigger organizations which is a proof that it is a good system
- Manages big hierarchies and intra-company tickets too
- Provides a Resource Guide so SOPs can be written in them which saves time of the employees.

### Cons:

- Starts at USD 10 per month and scales up from there
- An overkill unless its being used by a bigger company

## Third Pick: Kayako

Kayako is also a premium ticketing solution. It is almost like Jira Service Desk in its features but it does provide some unique features that make it an interesting one to consider too. It provides user stories which let you know what steps your customer took before they opened a ticket. These steps help you better help the customer. The Free Collaborator feature also allows the rest of the team to help with the ticket if they are free however their replies to the ticket are not shown to the customer. This combined with integration with popular platforms such as Slack, Salesforce, Zapier etc. and its easy to use Automation system makes it a great choice for a team no matter its size.

### Pros:

- Used by popular organizations big and small like General Electric, Warner Bros and FedEx
- User stories provide useful context for the person assigned to the ticket
- Free Collaborators can jump in and help without the customer noticing anything

### Cons:

- Starting at USD 15 per month, its even more expensive than Jira. Especially when most features don't unlock until you get the USD 30 per month package
- User interface is not as clean as Jira Service Desk
