# Issue Tracking System / Ticketing Mangemnet 
An __issue tracking system__ (also __incident ticket system__ or __ITS__) is a computer software package that manages and manipulates lists of [Issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management#Issue). These systems are generally used when more than one person are working on a same project. But it can also be used by individuals for thier [time mangemnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) or [personal productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software).

In organizations, ITS are commonly used for [customer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_support)[call center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_center) or even issues reported by eymployes of that organization. This system also contains [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) information of every customer, solution of same  problems and other such information.

ITS is similar to [bugtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtracker). Bugtracker can be used as ITS and vice versa. It is a good practice for a software team to use ITS. A __ticket__ element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a [help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_desk) or [call center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_center) environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.

These tickets are called so because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started. Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position (usually the last) in a column of *pending slots* for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.

Similarity between ITS and bugtracker is that a valid issue must be amenable to a decisive resolution; that each case is unique and beyond screening stage that there is one person assigned formal responsibilty to move the issue forward. Also in generalized issue tracking systems, the tickets are often service-related or relationship-based, with closer ties to [customer relationship management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (CRM) concerns. But in  bug trackers, issues are generally quality or feature related with respect to a codebase (which is inherently a [project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) setting).

## Issues
Issues can have several aspects to them. Each issue in the system may have an urgency value assigned to it, based on the overall importance of that issue. Low or zero urgency issues are minor and should be resolved as time permits. Other details of issues include the customer experiencing the issue (whether external or internal), date of submission, detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information. Each issue maintains a history of each change.

## Functions
ITS fullfill different functions,in particular:
- Entering of dysfunctions, errors and requests (e.g. manually or by e-mail Response Management Systems)
- Distribution and assignment of issues to persons in charge
- Monitoring of handling, time spent and quality of work
- Ensuring the observation of internal processes by forced control with help of workflows
- Statistical analysis of the number of tickets
- Automatic generation of tickets by alarming systems, e.g. [network monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring)
- Fulfillment of external service agreements (Service Level Agreement, [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement))
- Systematic collection of questions and answers for [FAQs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ)
- Assignment of a priority to each issue based on the overall importance of that issue, the customer, date of submission, SLA
- Containing a detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information
- Maintaining of a history of each change
