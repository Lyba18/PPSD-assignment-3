# Issue Tracking System / Ticketing Mangemnet 
An __issue tracking system__ (also __incident ticket system__ or __ITS__) is a computer software package that manages and manipulates lists of [Issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management#Issue). These systems are generally used when more than one person are working on a same project. But it can also be used by individuals for thier [time mangemnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) or [personal productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software).

In organizations, ITS are commonly used for [customer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_support)[call center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_center) or even issues reported by eymployes of that organization. This system also contains [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) information of every customer, solution of same  problems and other such information.

ITS is similar to [bugtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtracker). Bugtracker can be used as ITS and vice versa. It is a good practice for a software team to use ITS. A __ticket__ element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a [help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_desk) or [call center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_center) environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.
