# GitHub Issues
Life Cycle of ticket starts with issuing it. Once a ticket is created agents work on the ticket and perform several actions based on their roles.

## Submission of Issues
Submission of issues is done by Agent. It is done is simple steps like : _Writing the name of Ticket_, _Giving some details_, _if possible a secreen shot of problem_ and _Taging the developer_ etc.

Submission of ticket give a notification to taged __Developer__.

## Agent and Team Assignment
After receiving a ticket notification. The ticket is assigned or reassigned to a team of agents or an individual agent.

When enabled, alerts and details are sent out to assignee or team members.

## Transferring Departments
It can also assign outside of department taht is called transfer of department. Department setting determines if a ticket can be assigned to agents outside the current department.

## State and Status
During it's lifecycle, a ticket can either be in open or closed state . Administratively-defined statuses can be used to further defined internal state of a ticket.

## SLA and Due dates
SLA Plans or Service Level Agreements are used to determined how long a ticket can remain open, before it's marked overdue. System Default SLA Plan is used on new tickets, unless it's overridden at Departments, Ticket Filters and Help Topics level.

Transient SLAs are considered temporary and can be overridden by a non-transient SLA on Department transfer or Help Topic change. Setting a Due Date will override/disable any SLA set on the ticket.

Overdue tickets appear in Overdue Queue.

## Ticket Editing
Ability to edit ticket information can be administratively disabled in Admin Panel for End Users or by removing the permission from Agents
